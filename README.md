# TorClient

## Help

It has a terminal for partial client management, all commands you can get by typing - help

this client is an alpha version, so it has a bunch of bugs and flaws from a regular tor browser, in the future this client will receive a large number of updates and improvements, so you shouldn't pour shit on it.

## Installation

the installation does not require downloading python packages since the client itself is packaged in an exe, the resource will be in the repository, if you want to add something, go ahead, it's up to you.
